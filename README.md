# Ashe's Code Challenge

### NOTES

* This project includes Minified and Transpiled code through the Babel CLI. I have not built a babel.config.js file for this project, although it could be added if requested. 

* Utilizes JQuery and Debounce libraries.

# Parallax Landing Page

Build a landing page that exhibits several [parallax transitions](https://www.awwwards.com/30-great-websites-with-parallax-scrolling.html). 


In the `assets.zip` you will find 5 images, and a Parallax demo video.  
### Instructions

The video demonstrates the kind of transitions intended for the deliverable.  You will create a parallax page with 5 'positions' using the background images included in the `zip`.  At the bottom of this readme are 5 sections of text that you should use for the overlay regions.

##### Other Implementations Details

* The background and overlay later move independently.
* The overlays crosssfade.
* Scrolling between positions is triggered after a given scroll distance, and then occurs as a complete transition. The transitions do not happen gradually based on the current scroll position.
* The transition buttons are part of the spec.
* The hamburger menu is not part of the spec.
* The more-options menu does not need to be implemented.

### Context

You can use any library or framework with the exception of verbatim use of published demo code.  You do not need to use React, Vue, or other base framework.  

Treat this as if you were releasing a product to users, aim for code you would want to be in production. Ex: follow good scalability and maintenance practices, test responsively on multiple browsers, catch and handle errors, ensure all requirements are functional etc.

Zip all files, including any readme, as needed, and email them or send a link to where they can be downloaded.

## Section Text

#### Mountain
```
In the wild
There is no healthcare
```

> Healthcare is "Oh, I broke my leg!" A lion comes and eats you. You're dead. Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.


#### Meadow
```
How would I describe myself? 
Three words: 
```
> Hard working... Alpha male... Jackhammer... Merciless... Insatiableâ€¦ Before I do anything, 
I ask myself... "Would an idiot do that?" And if the answer is yes, I do not do that thing.



#### Ocean
```
Dolphins aren't smart. 
They just like pushing things.
```
> Dolphins get a lot of good publicity for the drowning swimmers they push back to shore, but what you don't hear about is the many people they push farther out to sea. 


#### Desert
```
I am faster than 
80% of all snakes. 
```
> Question: You know what's better than a triceratops? Only every other dinosaur that has ever existed.


#### Snow
```
When I die. 
I want to be frozen. 
```
> I will wake up stronger than ever, because I will have used that time, to figure out exactly why I died. And what moves I could have used to defend myself better.
